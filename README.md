# Blog App with Flutter

I'm developing a mobile app with Flutter for an Instagram account.
The app will initially be used to display categorized content.

Currently, there are features such as light-dark theme, text sharing, application sharing, write to us.
In the next updates, features such as liking and commenting will be added.

I used Cloud Firestore for database and Cloud Storage for Firebase for storage.
